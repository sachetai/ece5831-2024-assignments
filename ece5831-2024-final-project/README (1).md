## Motivation

In the era of advanced AI, interpreting human attributes has become crucial for improving user experiences and enabling adaptive systems. Gender recognition and mood detection have applications in psychological research, security systems, and accessibility tools. The Aura Sense project aims to bridge the gap between AI capabilities and human understanding.

## Project Objectives

- Develop a robust gender recognition system using facial image analysis.
- Build a real-time mood detection model for identifying emotional states.
- Explore multi-modal integration techniques for enhanced human attribute recognition.

## Significance
